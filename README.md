# mc-portal-resources

This is my current project: creating Portal (2) in vanilla minecraft. You will need the datapack [here](https://github.com/DerBejijing/mc-portal-engine) to use it.  


**Installation**  
Drag the .zip archive in your resoucepacks folder.  
Start minecraft.  
Enable the resourcepacks in the options.  
Done!
