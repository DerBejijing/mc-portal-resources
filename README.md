# mc-portal-resources

This is my current project: creating Portal (2) in vanilla minecraft. You will need the datapack to use it.  

Rules
You are allowed to:
  - modify the code
  - add your own stuff
  - showcase it to others

However, you are not allowed to
    - use it for commercial purposes (eg. selling it), even if you modified it
    - call it your own

Please always link me as the creator :)


**Installation**  
Drag the .zip archive in your resoucepacks folder.
Start minecraft.
Enable the resourcepacks in the options.
Done!
